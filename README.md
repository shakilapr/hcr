Training a neural network to recognize handwritten characters (both simple and capital letters) using Python and TensorFlow. 
For the image set, **EMNIST** data set is used.

Handwritten character recognition is a challenging task, since handwriting characters are different from person to person. 
Therefore, it seems that there is still no handwriting recognition system, that can detect all the variations of handwritten characters perfectly.

To get a higher accuracy, itâ€™s important to train a large data set. But, developing a dataset with thousands of letters is extremely time consuming.
Since there is already collected and labeled datasets, I decided to use one of them.
